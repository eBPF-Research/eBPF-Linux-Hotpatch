Redis 5.0 RC1   Released Tue May 29 14:14:11 CEST 2018
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency LOW: This is the first RC of Redis 5.

Introduction to the Redis 5 release
===================================

Redis 5 is a release focused on a few important features. While Redis 4
was very very focused on operations, Redis 5 changes are mostly user-facing,
with the implementation of new data types and operations on top of existing
types. The following are the major features of this release:

1. The new Stream data type. https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
2. New Redis modules APIs: Timers and Cluster API.
3. RDB now store LFU and LRU information.
4. The cluster manager was ported from Ruby (redis-trib.rb) to C code
   inside redis-cli. Check `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
5. New sorted set commands: ZPOPMIN/MAX and blocking variants.
6. Active defragmentation version 2.
7. Improvemenets in HyperLogLog implementations.
8. Better memory reporting capabilities.
9. Many commands with sub-commands now have an HELP subcommand.
10. Better performances when clients connect and disconnect often.
11. Many bug fixes and other random improvements.
12. Jemalloc was upgraded to version 5.1

Thanks to all the users and developers who made this release possible.
We'll follow up with more RC releases, until the code looks production ready
and we don't get reports of serious issues for a while.

Migrating from 4.0 to 5.0
=========================

Redis 4.0 is mostly a strict subset of 5.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 4.0 to 5.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 5.0 release:

* redis-cli now implements the cluster management tool. We still ship the
  old redis-trib, but new fixes will be implemented only in redis-cli.
  See `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.

* The RDB format changed. Redis 5.0 is still able to read 4.0 (and all the
  past versions) files, but not the other way around.

* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 5.0.
